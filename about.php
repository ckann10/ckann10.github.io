      <p>Welcome to my website! I am currently a graduate student in the Social Sciences department at California Institute of Technology studying American Poltics and Political Methodology with a focus on polticial behaviour. My background is in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in control and dynamical systems and I try to bring the techniques I used in those fields to Political Science. I am particularly interested in the politics around inclusion and understanding whose voices are heard in the American political system.
