      <p>Working with the <a href = 'https://monitoringtheelection.us/'> Monitoring Election Team </a> as part of the Celtech/MIT Voting Technology Project:</p>
      <p> "Questions often arise after contested elections:  was the election conducted in a free and fair manner?  This was certainly the case in 2016, where many concerns were raised before, during, and after the presidential election --- in particular about the potential intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by foreign governments or their agents. </p>
      <p>As we head into the 2020 U.S. election cycle, our project will election officials in California and Oregon to build comprehensive quantitative election performance auditing applications.  Currently we are working with Orange County and Los Angeles County (California) and with the State of Oregon.  We will be providing additional details of the 2020 projects in the very near future. This research project is developing and implementing comprehensive ecological methodology to evaluate the conduct of state and federal elections in Southern California" </p>

        <p> Who donates to political candidates? When do they donate? What do these donation patterns say about both the candidates and the donors? </p>
        <p> In this project I am quantifying what has been lost in previous studies on Campaign Finance when small donors, those who donate less than $200 and are thus not recorded individually in FEC reports, are overlooked. </p>

Cassie is a facinating robot to work with, with a larger center of mass 
              in its torso and very light legs in theory one can apply techniques developed for smipler robots. In my work on Cassie, I developed a method to implement highly theoretical methods on Cassie with impressive results. </p>

           <p> At Rice University, in the <a href = "https://mahilab.rice.edu/">Mechatronics and Haptic Interfaces Lab</a>, I worked on robotic wrist rehabilitation. Specifically, I was studying the effects of these robotic devices on how people move. Robots offer a solution for when repetative motions are needed to performed and there is a shortage of physical therapists, but we question where it is an acceptable replacement. </p>
