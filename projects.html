        <p> Protest movements are one of the key ways the citizens interact with the political system unoffocially. Yet, according to theoretical models
        there is no rational explanation for these behaviors. Using social media evidence from the Black Lives Matter protests in the Summer of 2020 
        I explicitly opperationalize interest and collective identity in order to investigate how each intereacts with protest activity. In addition, 
          I created a package in order to streamline future collection of Twitter data for dynamic events, such as protest movements, extreme weather events, 
          or even music tours.

        <p> Staggering sums of money are today raised and spent by candidates running for U.S. federal office. 
          These vast sums of money being raised in U.S. federal elections flow into the campaign war chests of
          those running for the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, and the presidency. Even candidates running today 
          for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives may often need to raise millions of dollars every two 
          years, and when there is an open House seat, a candidate may need to raise ten million dollars or more 
          to be successful.  </p>
        <p> The Federal Election Comission keeps a record of all federal campaign donations above $200. Using this 
        data I am working on two projects. The first is a book which analyzes the donation patterns from 1990 to 2020.
        This is the first comprehensive work of this scale and will inform the community both on the trends of donations
        as well as who is donating. This can provide a commentary on whether all citizen's voices are being heard equally.</p>
        <p> In the second project I am looking at how donation patterns are affected by the legislation promited by incumbents. 
          Specifically, I look to see if the money going to politicians changes when they sponsor legislation specifically 
          aimed at historically margnialized groups. Specifically, I focus on abortion access and voting accessibility legislation
          with various economic and international affairs legislation as a control.

This was certainly the case in 2016, where many concerns were raised before, during, and after the presidential election --- in particular about the potential intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by foreign governments or their agents. </p>
      <p>As we head into the 2020 U.S. election cycle, our project will election officials in California and Oregon to build comprehensive quantitative election performance auditing applications.  Currently we are working with Orange County and Los Angeles County (California) and with the State of Oregon.  We will be providing additional details of the 2020 projects in the very near future. This research project is developing and implementing comprehensive ecological methodology to evaluate the conduct of state and federal elections in Southern California" </p>

Cassie is a facinating robot to work with, with a larger center of mass 
              in its torso and very light legs in theory one can apply techniques developed for smipler robots. In my work on Cassie, I developed a method to implement highly theoretical methods on Cassie with impressive results. </p>
